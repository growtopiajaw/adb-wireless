# adb-wireless

# Overview
----------


adb-wireless is a simple helper script for newbies that hates command line (like the old me) to connect device with adb via Wi-Fi to use with apps such as Vysor by Koush Dutta.

This script first started out only for my own usage. Later on, I wonder if I should share this script to the Internet since I've used many open source projects and also wanted to help the open source world.

# Usage
-------


As said in it's name. It is made to be as simple as it can be.
1. Connect device with adb via Wi-Fi through IP address

# Running the script
--------------------


`cd adb-wireless-master`

`./adb-wireless`

Alternatively, if you want the script to be more verbose, simply just run the script

`./adb-wireless-debug`
